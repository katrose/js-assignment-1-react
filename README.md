# Javascript Assignment #1 - Adding Tiles

Deployed on Netlify: https://js-assignment-1-react.netlify.com

This version of the assignment was done with React, by basically turning each section of the mock website into a React component. The whole website is then rendered in the main App component in index.js.

Note: I wasn't able to implement sort functions with React (yet), but they are included in the plain Javascript version of Assignment #1: https://github.com/katrose/js-assignment-1
